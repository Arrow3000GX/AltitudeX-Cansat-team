## Project Overview

Our CanSat project aims to design, build, and launch a miniature satellite that can collect environmental data and perform scientific experiments.  
This project is part of **[Competition Name]** and serves as a platform for learning and applying aerospace engineering concepts.

---

## Mission Objectives

1. **Primary Mission:** Collect atmospheric data such as temperature, pressure, and humidity during descent.  
2. **Secondary Mission:** Perform additional experiments, e.g., measuring air quality or deploying a sensor payload.  
3. **Data Transmission:** Send real-time data to the ground station for analysis.

## System Architecture

The CanSat system is divided into the following subsystems:

- **Flight Module:** Handles flight stabilization, sensor data acquisition, and communication.  
- **Ground Station:** Receives telemetry, logs data, and monitors mission progress.  
- **Payload Module:** Conducts scientific experiments and captures experimental data.

---

## Hardware

Key hardware components:

- Microcontroller: e.g., Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi Pico  
- Sensors: e.g., BMP280, DHT22, GPS module  
- Communication: e.g., RF module, LoRa  
- Power Supply: e.g., LiPo battery, voltage regulator  
- Structural Components: e.g., 3D-printed frame, parachute system

---

## Software

The CanSat software stack includes:

- **Firmware:** Runs on the microcontroller for sensor reading, data logging, and telemetry.  
- **Ground Station:** Python scripts for receiving, logging, and visualizing telemetry.  
- **Data Analysis:** Scripts for analyzing and plotting mission data.
